# Machine Learning Regression

## Overview

The goal of this project is to show a practical application of machine learning on a real-world dataset.

More specifically, the goal is to estimate house prices based on several features provided in the dataset. 

It provides a view into the methodologies and approaches adopted by a data scientist in modeling, evaluating, and interpreting a regression problem. 


## Data

The dataset contains information on 1460 houses, each with a price and 79 descriptive features.[^1]
